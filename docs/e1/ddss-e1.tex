\section{Architectural design}

Figure~\ref{fig:arch} shows the architectural design of the BitTorrent Tracker.
All the tracker swarm members receive UDP multicast requests from the peers;
however, just the master answers.
The communication between the peers is done via UDP, and the
tracker's instances contemplate UDP/JMS communication among them.

\end{table}

The tracker's functionality is summarised in table~\ref{tab:fun-entities}.
The following list describes more thoroughly the functions previously shown in
table~\ref{tab:fun-entities} that each component is responsible for:

\begin{itemize}
\item Master tracker
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Cluster Fault Tolerance System}: this component is implemented
    in all the tracker's instances, and it is in charge of knowing the state
    of all the instances. This component sends and receives Keepalive (KA)
    messages from all the instances of the cluster.
    When the master dies sends a
    notification to the \emph{Master Election System} to start the new master
    election process.
  \item \emph{Peer Info Sender}: answers to a client's information request 
    sending
    information about the available peers with a specific content.
  \item \emph{Master DB Fault Tolerance System}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{DB Manager}: handles the Master-Slave database schema described
      at Section~\ref{sec:data-schema}, see figure~\ref{fig:schema-MS}.
    \item \emph{Master Consensus System}: it has two main functions, (i) when a
      DB transaction needs to be propagated among all the instances,
      this component is in charge of coordinating such event by waiting for all
      the instances to be ready, and transmitting the order; (ii) when a
      new slave is created it sends the necessary information to keep its
      DB up to date.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item Tracker slaves
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Cluster Fault Tolerance System}: refer to the Master Tracker's
    description of this item.
  \item \emph{Master Election System}: it is notified by the
    \emph{Cluster Fault Tolerance System} about a failure in the Master. This
    component selects a new master among the available slaves. When activated,
    and while the Master election process lasts, the tracker will not listen to
    the clients requests.
  \item \emph{Slave DB Fault Tolerance System}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{DB Manager}: refer to the Master Tracker's description of this
      item.
    \item \emph{Slave Consensus System}: this component has two functions; on
      the one hand
      (i) when the \emph{Master Consensus System} requests an operation to be
      propagated, checks the slave's status and prepares it to do such
      operation; when the slave is ready, notifies the master, and finally, when
      the master orders to commit, complies. On the other hand, (ii) when the
      slave is a brand-new instance, it requests the latest DB information to
      the master and waits for its instructions to commit.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item Peers
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Peer Info Requester}: requests information to the tracker about
    the available peers with some content.
  \item \emph{Download Manager}: manages the download process.
  \item \emph{Upload Manager}: manages the upload process.
  \item \emph{DB Manager}: handles the Peer database schema described at
    Section~\ref{sec:data-schema}, see figure~\ref{fig:schema-P}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Data schema}\label{sec:data-schema}

Our system contemplates two different database schemas, on the one hand the
tracker's master and slaves will implement the schema shown in
figure~\ref{fig:schema-MS}. This schema has two tables: (i) \texttt{PEER-INFO}
where information regarding the peers' host and ports is stored; and (ii)
\texttt{CONTENTS}, where the tracker will store which peers have available some
specific content. Both tables' fields are self-descriptive.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \texttt{PEER-INFO (\underline{id:INTEGER}, host:VARCHAR(255), port:INTEGER)}
  
  \texttt{CONTENTS (\underline{sha1:STRING(40)}, \underline{peer\_id:INTEGER})}
  
  \centering
  \caption{\label{fig:schema-MS}DB schema for the tracker's master and slaves.}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, the peers will need to remember the
progress they have made during a download; thereby, they will store which chucks
they have downloaded so far for a specific file. It must be underlined that our
system will always transfer chunks of the same size, with the exception of the
last chunk, or when the content's size is inferior to our default chunk size.

This characteristic is implemented using the schema shown in
figure~\ref{fig:schema-P}, with the table \texttt{CHUNK}; its
fields are self-descriptive.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \texttt{CHUNK (\underline{sha1:STRING(40)}, offset:INTEGER)}
  
  \centering
  \caption{\label{fig:schema-P}DB schema for the tracker's peers.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{DB technology}

We have decided to use SQLite~\cite{sqlite} as our storage technology,
mainly because we have previous experience with it; but more importantly,
because this is a didactic project without the high availability and performance
needs that a professional project's database requires.

Regarding the use of a classic SQL database over the NoSQL paradigm, since
this project implies the synchronisation of the DB over the trackers, we think
that the data should be as normalised as possible and complying to the third
normal form (3NF); thereby, we discard NoSQL databases.

\section{Interaction model design}

The following section describes the interaction model design, we have taken
into account the interaction model described at~\cite{libtorrent,bittheory},
as well as the BitTorrent specification~\cite{bep03,bep15,bep23} to make our
own.

\begin{itemize}
\item Tracker-Tracker.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Keepalive (KA) messages: are sent every second to all the instances
    in the tracker swarm. A member is considered down if two followed KA
    messages are not received.

    A KA message has the following structure:

    \texttt{[type, ID]}

    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{type} (32 bits): 0, for KA message.
    \item \texttt{ID} (160 bits): ID of the instance.
    \end{itemize}

    All swarm members must keep and update a table (for now on referred as the
    \emph{IP-ID} table) with the values: \texttt{ID-IP-port},
    that collects information of the ID, IP and port of all the alive
    instances. 
    
  \item Master election (ME) messages: these messages are sent when the master
    is down (two followed KA messages aren't received). These messages are sent
    every 3 seconds during the Master Election process. The messages have
    the following format:

    \texttt{[type, payload]}

    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{type} (32 bits): 1, for ME message.  
    \item \texttt{payload} (160 bits): the minimum tracker ID.
    \end{itemize}

    These messages must be sent to all tracker swarm members when the a slave
    detects that the master is down. The slave chooses the minimum ID among
    the slaves that appear at its own IP-ID table (taking into account its own
    ID), and sends its decision to all the swarm members. It must wait to
    receive ME messages from all the members of its IP-ID table. 
    
  \item Hello (HI) messages:
    these messages are sent when a instance wants to join the tracker swarm.
    The new instance must begin sending KA messages even though it does not
    have still an ID.
    They have the following format:

    \texttt{[type, connection\_id]}

    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{type} (32 bits): 2, for HI message.
    \item \texttt{connection\_id} (64 bits): randomly selected by the new
      instance.
    \end{itemize}

    When a HI message is received the master will answer with the following
    packets:

    \texttt{[type, connection\_id, assigned\_id, contents\_sha,
        [info\_hash, host, port]..., ]}

    Where:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{type} (32 bits): 2, for HI message.
    \item \texttt{connection\_id} (64 bits): the same
      \texttt{connection\_id} sent by the new instance.
    \item \texttt{assigned\_id} (160 bits): the ID assigned for this instance
      by the master.
    \item \texttt{contents\_sha} (160 bits): SHA-1 of the
      \texttt{(info\_hash, host, port)} triplets.
    \item \texttt{info\_hash} (160 bits): SHA-1 of the torrent.
    \item \texttt{host} (32 bits): IP of the peer that has the torrent.
    \item \texttt{port} (16 bits): port of the peer that has the torrent..
    \end{itemize}

    The last \texttt{(info\_hash, host, port)} triplet will be repeated for each
    row in the \texttt{CONTENTS} table of the master.

    When the new tracker slave successfully receives the master's data it will
    send the following packet:

    \texttt{[type, connection\_id, assigned\_id, contents\_sha]}

    Where:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{type} (32 bits): 2, for HI message.
    \item \texttt{connection\_id} (64 bits): the same
      \texttt{connection\_id} sent by the new instance.
    \item \texttt{assigned\_id} (160 bits): the ID assigned for this instance
      by the master.
    \item \texttt{contents\_sha} (160 bits): SHA-1 of the
      \texttt{(info\_hash, host, port)} triplets.
    \end{itemize}

  \item Database synchronisation (DS) messages: for each peer scraping request
    listened by the tracker, the slaves must send a \emph{DS-ready} message
    if they have listened
    the request, which  indicates that they are ready to commit.
    This packet has the
    following fields:

    \texttt{[type, connection\_id, action, transaction\_id, [info\_hash]\ldots]}

    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{type} (32 bits): 3 for \emph{DS-ready} message.
    \item \texttt{connection\_id} (64 bits), \texttt{action} (32 bits),
      \texttt{transaction\_id} (32 bits) and \texttt{info\_hash} (160 bits):
      are the fields described at \emph{Peer announce}, interaction 1.
    \end{itemize}

    When the master has received this packet from all the slaves at its IP-ID
    table, it will send a \emph{DS-commit} message, that will indicate to
    the slaves that they must commit the changes. This packet has the following
    structure:

    \texttt{[type, connection\_id, action, transaction\_id]}

    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{type} (32 bits): 4 for \emph{DS-commit} message.
    \item \texttt{connection\_id} (64 bits), \texttt{action} (32 bits),
      \texttt{transaction\_id} (32 bits): are the fields of the previous packet
      without the variable \texttt{info\_hash}es.
    \end{itemize}

    When the slave successfully commits, it must send a \emph{DS-done} packet:
    
    \texttt{[type, connection\_id, action, transaction\_id]}

    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{type} (32 bits): 5 for \emph{DS-done} message.
    \item \texttt{connection\_id} (64 bits), \texttt{action} (32 bits),
      \texttt{transaction\_id} (32 bits): are the fields of the previous packet
      without the variable \texttt{info\_hash}es.
    \end{itemize}
    
  \end{enumerate}
\item Tracker-Peer
  \begin{itemize}
    % FIRST
  \item Connection request: a peer requests a
    connection to the tracker to execute a specific action.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Peer requests the connection with the following packet (128 bits):

      \texttt{[connection\_id, action, transaction\_id]}
      
      Where:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{connection\_id} (64 bits): initialised to
        % TODO: think of the coolest magic number
        \texttt{0xFEELDEADBAADBEEF}.
      \item \texttt{action} (32 bits): 0, for connection request.
      \item \texttt{transaction\_id} (32 bits): random number generated by the
        peer.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Master tracker answers with one of these packets (128 bits):
      \begin{enumerate}  

      \item Normal response (128 bits):
        
        \texttt{[action, transaction\_id, connection\_id]}

        Where:  
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{action} (32 bits): 0, for connection request.
        \item \texttt{transaction\_id} (32 bits)
          the \texttt{transaction\_id} previously sent by the peer.
        \item \texttt{connection\_id} (64 bits):
          the \texttt{connection\_id} generated by the tracker, which will be
          used by the peer in future requests. The peer can use the same
          \texttt{connection\_id} for one minute, the tracker will accept the
          \texttt{connection\_id} for a specific peer for two minutes.
        \end{itemize}

      \item Error response ($\geq64$ bits)\label{it:error-response}:
        
        \texttt{[action, transaction\_id, error\_string]} 

        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{action} (32 bits): 3, for error.
        \item \texttt{transaction\_id} (32 bits)
          the \texttt{transaction\_id} previously sent by the peer.
        \item \texttt{error\_string}: string describing the error, may be left
          empty.
        \end{itemize}

        This error response is used by the master at every error situation,
        thereby we will be referring to this packet in future error situations.
        
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

    % SECOND
  \item Peer announce: a peer requests info about a torrent.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Peer sends the following packet (784 bits):

      \texttt{[connection\_id, action, transaction\_id, info\_hash, peer\_id,
          downloaded, left, uploaded, event, ip, key, num\_want, port]}

      Where:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{connection\_id} (64 bits): id given by the tracker after
        successfully establishing a connection.
      \item \texttt{action} (32 bits): 1, for announce.
      \item \texttt{transaction\_id} (32 bits): random number generated by the
        peer.
      \item \texttt{info\_hash} (160 bits): SHA-1 of the announcing torrent.
      \item \texttt{peer\_id} (160 bits): peer's id.
      \item \texttt{downloaded} (64 bits): number of bytes downloaded in this
        session.
      \item \texttt{left} (64 bits): number of bytes left to download.
      \item \texttt{uploaded} (64 bits): number of bytes uploaded in this
        session.
      \item \texttt{event} (32 bits): status; 0 none, 1 completed, 2 started,
        3 stopped.
      \item \texttt{ip} (32 bits): peer's IP address.
      \item \texttt{key} (32 bits): unique key generated by the peer.
      \item \texttt{num\_want} (32 bits): maximum number of peers wanted in the
        reply. A -1 indicates that the peer wants at most the tracker's default
        value. % 4294967295
      \item \texttt{port} (16 bits): the port the peer is listening to.
      \end{itemize}

    \item Master tracker replies with one of these packets:

      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Normal response (160 bits (min), to 4096 bits (max)
        $(160\ bits + (48\ bits * 82\ tuples))$):
        \texttt{[action, transaction\_id, interval, leechers, seeders,
            (ip, port)\ldots]}
        
        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{action} (32 bits): 1, for announce.
        \item \texttt{transaction\_id} (32 bits): the \texttt{transaction\_id}
          previously sent by the peer.
        \item \texttt{interval} (32 bits): minimum number of seconds that the
          peer must wait before reannouncing itself.
        \item \texttt{leechers} (32 bits): number of peers in the swarm still
          downloading.
        \item \texttt{seeders} (32 bits): number of peers in the swarm which
          are seeding.
        \item \texttt{ip} (32 bits): ip of a peer.
        \item \texttt{port} (16 bits): listening port of a peer.
        \end{itemize}

        The \texttt{(ip, port)} tuple is optional, it may happen that there
        aren't any seeders for the torrent.

        Note that the tracker answers by default using the Compact Peer List
        extension, which uses 6 bytes to represent a peer, as described at BEP
        23~\cite{bep23}.

      \item If there are errors ($\geq64$ bits):
        The master sends the packet described at
        \emph{Connection request}, iteration~\ref{it:error-response}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

    % THIRD
  \item Peer scraping: a peer sends information about a torrent file.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Peers sends info (288 bits (min), 3968 bits (max)
      $(288\ bits + (160\ bits * 23\ hashes))$):

      \texttt{[connection\_id, action, transaction\_id,
          [info\_hash]\ldots]}

      Where:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{connection\_id} (64 bits): id given by the tracker after
        successfully establishing a connection.
      \item \texttt{action} (32 bits): 2, for scrape.
      \item \texttt{transaction\_id} (32 bits): random number generated by
        the peer.
      \item \texttt{info\_hash} (160 bits): SHA-1 of the resource (at least
        one). 
      \end{itemize}
      
    \item Master tracker replies:

      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Normal response (160 bits):

        \texttt{[action, transaction\_id, [seeders, complete, leechers]\ldots]}

        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{action} (32 bits): 2, for scrape.
        \item \texttt{transaction\_id} (32 bits): the \texttt{transaction\_id}
          previously sent by the peer.

          been downloaded.
        \item \texttt{leechers} (32 bits): number of leechers.
        \end{itemize}

        The triplet \texttt{(seeders, complete, leechers)} must appear at least
        once, and repeats for each \texttt{info\_hash} asked in the scraping
        request.
        
      \item If there are errors (128 bits): The master sends the packet
        described at \emph{Connection request},
        iteration~\ref{it:error-response}.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Failure model design}

\begin{itemize}
\item Tracker-Tracker
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Keepalive (KA) messages: there is no failure model for this type of
    messages.
  \item Master Election (ME) messages: depend on the values of the IP-ID table
    that each slave has. When an election is in progress, each slave must
    wait until it receives the decisions of all the members of its IP-ID table.
    If everything goes right, (Situation-A) the slave with the lowest ID is
    chosen as the new master; however, during the election several things may go
    wrong.
    
    -If a slave incorrectly chooses an ID which is not the lowest (according to
    an accurate IP-ID table),
    it must listen to what the majority of the votes says (Situation-B). This
    may happen when two  KA messages of the lowest-ID-slave do not reach
    that slave, and the slave chooses wrongly.
    
    -If there is not a majority, the election process will continue until
    Situation-A or Situation-B is reached. Situation-A or Situation-B will be
    eventually reachable when (i) ME messages are correctly delivered or, (ii)
    the IP-ID table is updated.

    -If Situation-A is not reached and by Situation-B the majority of the slaves
    chooses wrongly, a new election will start, since in the IP-ID table the
    master won't be the one with the lowest ID.
    
    This process will be repeated until consensus is reached. 
  \item Hello (HI) messages: these messages will be ignored during a Master
    Election process.

    The new instance must wait 3 seconds if no KA messages
    are listened to elect itself as master, when it elects itself as master
    its ID will be a random version 4 UUID (which are virtually impossible to
    be the same in two or more instances). If two or more new instances
    elect themselves as masters, when the KA messages eventually reach their
    destinations, a Master Election process will start, since all the instances
    but one will have wrongly chosen themselves as masters.

    When the tracker master answers to a HI message, it will wait 10 seconds
    until the new slave answers with the confirmation, if no response is
    received the master will resend the request. This scheme will be repeated
    until the new slave confirms the transaction, or the slave goes down.
  \item Database synchronisation (DS) messages:
    when the master does not
    receive a \emph{DS-ready} message within 10 seconds from all the members
    that it has on its own IP-ID table, it will send again the scraping request
    originally sent by the peer until the slave sends the \emph{DS-ready}
    packet or the slave goes down. When this is completed, it will follow the
    same scheme when the \emph{DS-done} messages are not received.
    
    DB synchronisation is a key issue in the tracker, and thereby it is forced.

    The scraping messages are stored in a FIFO structure in all the swarm
    members, so until transaction N has been done, transaction N + 1 will not
    start. Thereby, if a master dies the new master chosen after the ME process
    and the new slaves will be consistent.
    
  \end{enumerate}
\item Tracker-Peer: For all the messages of this type, if no response is
  received after 15 seconds, the peer must resend the request. The peer should
  follow this scheme until one minute has passed from the first resend. If the
  tracker has not still answered, the peer must consider it down,
  and thereby notify the user accordingly.
